                  <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif;">
                  In our boarding houses (Halls of Residence), we created a special and welcoming atmosphere for our students, 
                  so that they can feel at home. Boarding at Sankt Georg International School offers the experience of being part of a friendly, 
                  close-knit school community. We encourage our pupils to be independent and self-reliant. We have two Rev. Sisters, a young and vibrant mother, 
                  and a responsible young man who are serving as Matrons in our Halls of Residence. These provide individual attention and encourage participation and collaboration among the students. 
                  Our rooms are spacious and well-ventilated with adequate restrooms and sanitary facilities. Each student is allocated their wardrobe to organize their uniform and clothes.  <br />
                  </br>
                        Our well-furnished common rooms are open and equipped with satellite television and many indoor games for students during their free time. 
                        While weekend activities are designed to be fun, they are also educative and sometimes challenging. We place a high premium on hygiene. 
                        That is why we maintain a quality laundry service program where students are taught how to wash their uniforms and take care of their underwear and nightwear themselves.
                        </br> </br>
                        Our Refectory is well-furnished, neat and homely. We have professional cooks who are passionate about cooking the best foods for our students. 
                        SGIS has come up with a well-balanced menu that ensures our students eat well and healthy. All these measures are geared towards fulfilling our vision of providing all-round development for the students of SGIS.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif;">
                        Please, contact the School Bursar or any member of the School Management Team for further inquiries on this. </p>
                        <h5 style="color:#4A0404; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif; font-size:20px;"> <b>Sibling Discount</b></h5>
                        <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif;">
                        Where three or more siblings are pupils at the same time, a discount is offered by SGIS. 
                        Please contact the Bursar or the School Management for more inquiries. 
                        It is worth it to have all your children with us. 
                        </p>

                        <h4 style="color:#4A0404; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif; font-size:30px;"><b>Extra-Curricular</b></h4>
                        <h6 style="color:#4A0404; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif; font-size:20px;"> <b>Religious Life</b></h6>
                        <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif;">
                        The school works in collaboration with the religious congregation of the Franciscan Missionary Disciples of Christ (FMDC) who take care of the spiritual life of the students in the Halls of Residence. 
                        A catholic priest serves as the School Administrator and another catholic priest gives Moral and Religious Instructions to the students three times in a week.  
                        </p>

                        <h6 style="color:#4A0404; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif; font-size:20px;"><b>Retreats</b></h6>
                        <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif;">
                        The school organizes retreats once a year to strengthen the spiritual life of the students. The two-day retreat precedes the summer camping trip. During retreats, there are no interactions with those outside the group. 
                        This lack of interaction with the outside world creates room for concentration and reflection. This time is purposefully thought out to give the students the opportunity to reflect on their life and future.  
                        </p>

                        <h6 style="color:#4A0404; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif; font-size:20px;"><b>Carols</b></h6>
                        <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif;">
                        Led by the students of the Music Club, the school organizes a Carol party yearly on the last day before the Christmas vacation. 
                        </p>

                        <h6 style="color:#4A0404; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif; font-size:20px;"><b>Sports</b></h6>
                        <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif;">
                        Sports are promoted in the school. Every year, inter-school games are held, in which prizes are given out. 
                        Inter-house sports are held every year too, and all these are arranged in a manner that they do not interfere with academic work. 
                        Facilities and equipment are provided to the students through the sports master.
                        </p>
                        <h6 style="color:#4A0404; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif; font-size:20px;"><b>Socials</b></h6>
                        <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif;">
                        Social events are organized for the students once a month. Events include Independence Day, children's day, Arts and Cultural festivities. Students are allowed to bring only two sets of mufti clothes, which may be worn during the socials. 
                        </p>
                        <h6 style="color:#4A0404; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif; font-size:20px;"><b>Clubs</b></h6>
                        <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif;">
                        In every session, students are assigned to different clubs. 
                        Clubs are created with teachers supervising them, such as Drama, Music, JETS, 
                        Young Farmers, Skill Acquisition, Literary and Debating, French, Arts, and more. Club meetings are held bi-weekly.
                        </p>

                        <h6 style="color:#4A0404; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif; font-size:20px;"><b>Project Exhibitions</b></h6>
                        <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif;">
                        The highlight of the academic year is the Project Exhibition which holds once a year. In this, 
                        parents are invited to the school to see projects done by their wards. 
                        The students present their projects and prizes are awarded for the best projects. 
                        Parents are made to do the judgment themselves. Also, clubs such as the Music club, 
                        French Club, Literary Society, and the popular Computer club, make presentations as well.
                        </p>
