                        <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif;">
                        The materials in our classroom are divided into five main areas. Activity with these materials involves physical and mental action, linking body and mind.
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Practical Life Exercises: such as pouring, grating, polishing, sorting washing, buttoning, etc. 
                                Help the child learn to function in his environment and begin more advanced learning. 
                                The child develops attention to detail and a lengthened span of concentration through the successful completion of these basic exercises.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Sensorial Activities: are designed to isolate and sharpen each of the five senses. 
                                Grading and comparing sounds, sizes, colors, textures, and shapes help organize the impressions a child receives.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Language Materials: are presented individually to take advantage of the most significant interest on the part of the child. 
                                Children are taught the sound and formation of the letters and kinaesthetically through the use of sand-paper letters and similar materials. 
                                Word-building activities of increasing difficulty are done over a long period of time.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Mathematical concepts: are presented through the extensive use of concrete materials. 
                                The child’s sensorial training enables him/her to identify and differentiate the idea of quantity built into the Montessori materials. 
                                The child gains the conception of numbers and their application in arithmetical operations.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                    Geography, social study, botany, zoology, science, music, and grammar are introduced through the use of concrete materials.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif;">
                        Enrichment activities are offered when available and in addition to activities involving the materials described above. 
                        A full day at school, therefore, includes a learning period, a listening period, a rest period, and individual and group activity periods. 
                        The individual and group activity periods comprise of art and craft projects, special interest units, cooking, music, games, and outdoor activities. 
                        The children are also expected, with the permission of their parents, to be part of the field trips that SGIS organizes for the Section throughout the school year. 
                        </p>

                        Every genuine educational development must strive to meet the needs of the child. It has to be child-centred so as to promote not only cognitive, 
                        affective, and psychomotor domains of skills but also develop the physical, moral, language, social, and emotional aspects and foundations of the child’s life. 
                        Sankt Georg Primary School program, therefore, encompasses all Nigerian Primary Schools’ subjects including computer appreciation and application, French language, 
                        Moral instruction, and club activities. The school has since its inception grown in prominence by vision, quality of programs, and dove-tailed syllabus.
